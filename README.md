Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This project reads data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" project and creates a summary analysis dataset.

Included in this repository are an R script (run_analysis.R) and a code book (CodeBook.md) describing the datasets created by run_analysis.R.

Data from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" can be found at:
   (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
   Copy the zip file containing the data to a directory, copy script to same directory and run in R.
   
   Two .txt files will be created, HARUS_data.txt and HARUS_SummaryData.txt as described in CodeBook.md.
   The second dataset, HARUS_SummaryData.txt, is the solution dataset for the course project.
